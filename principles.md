# Core Principles of Clean Code

Writing clean code is about embracing simplicity and clarity. Here are the fundamental principles that will help you write better code from day one.

## Clarity First

Your code should read like well-written prose. Choose names that tell a story:

```python
# Avoid cryptic names
def calc_diff(a, b):
    return a - b

# Express intent clearly
def calculate_age_difference(current_year, birth_year):
    return current_year - birth_year
```

## Keep It Focused

Each function or class should do one thing exceptionally well:

```javascript
// Too many responsibilities
function processUser(user) {
    validateData(user);
    saveToDatabase(user);
    sendWelcomeEmail(user);
}

// Single, clear purpose
function validateUser(user) {
    return isValidEmail(user.email) && 
           isValidAge(user.age);
}
```

## Stay Consistent

Maintain consistent patterns throughout your codebase:

```python
# Inconsistent naming
get_user_name()
fetchUserEmail()
UserReturnAge()

# Consistent naming
get_user_name()
get_user_email()
get_user_age()
```

## Write Self-Documenting Code

Let your code explain itself. Use comments only when necessary:

```java
// Avoid obvious comments
// Check if user is adult
if (age >= 18) { ... }

// Explain complex logic or business rules
// Apply senior discount on Tuesdays for members over 65
if (isTuesday() && age > 65 && isMember) { ... }
```

## Embrace Simplicity

Simple code is easier to understand, test, and maintain:

```python
# Overly complex
def is_valid_status(status):
    return True if status in ['active', 'pending'] else False

# Simple and clear
def is_valid_status(status):
    return status in ['active', 'pending']
```
